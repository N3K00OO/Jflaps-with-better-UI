JFLAP 7.1 - Modern UI build (unofficial)

This file describes modifications made to the original JFLAP 7.1 distribution.
The original JFLAP license text is included in this jar as `LICENSE`.

What changed:
- Added a launcher that uses FlatLaf for a more modern Swing UI (Darcula default).
- Added View > Theme switching (saved) and a Command Palette (Ctrl+K).
- Added View > Customize Theme... (RGB accent/background/canvas overrides, saved).
- Switched file open/save dialogs to the native OS file picker (`java.awt.FileDialog`) when possible (falls back to Swing `JFileChooser`).
- Patched JFLAP's automaton canvas background fill to support custom canvas colors.
- Patched JFLAP's transition labels/colors so they remain visible on dark canvases.
- Added canvas copy/paste on editor canvases (Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V) with deterministic renaming on paste. Patch tag: canvas-copy-paste-v1.
- Added runtime theming for toolbar icons and a visible delete cursor.
- Fixed Pumping Lemma dark-mode readability (HTML panes follow theme; re-applied after updates) and enlarged the "Explain" area.
- Added minimal `DOCS/` stubs (e.g. `DOCS/index.html`) so Help doesn't error in slim builds.
- Fixed a close-confirmation bug where clicking "Cancel" would still close the editor window.
- Removed the legacy menu-bar close button artifact (extra "X").

Changelog:
- 2026-02-11: Updated documentation and increased Pumping Lemma "Explain" area height.
- 2026-02-11: Added canvas copy/paste on editor canvases (Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V) with deterministic renaming on paste. Patch tag: canvas-copy-paste-v1.
